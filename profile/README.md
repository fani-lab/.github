## Hi there 👋
[`Fani's Lab`<em>`!`</em>](https://fani-lab.github.io) launched in 2020 at the School of Computer Science, University of Windsor, with generous support from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada ([``NSERC``](https://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/Professors-Professeurs/Grants-Subs/DGIGP-PSIGP_eng.asp)), performs research in the broad area of Social Network Analytics with special attention to temporal analysis and its synergy to Information Retrieval. Particularly, our research concerns ``user community detection``, ``user interest modelling``, ``team formation``, ``information retrieval``, ``text mining`` and ``machine learning``.

<img align="left" src="./open_access.png" width="20" height="20"> We believe in [``Open Access``](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_access) principles. We apply a range of practices through which the research outputs will be accessible online in a public repo with reduced and/or no copyright, free of cost or other access barriers for the purpose of publicly peer review and reuse.

<img align="left" src="./home.png" width="20" > We are located at [`3146 Erie Hall, University of Windsor, 401 Sunset Ave., Windsor, ON., N9B3P4, Canada`](https://maps.app.goo.gl/VvBTMqAF3wwxu8F56), `(519) 253-3000` Ext: `3743`.
